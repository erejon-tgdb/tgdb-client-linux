# NOTES:
# * THIS TEST SHOULD PASS WITH LINES 6, 12, 14 COMMENTED OUT.
# * Line 6 (NaN test) is the ONLY test that is a documented failure. There is a ticket (#410) for this fail.
# * Line 15 will fail with UniqueIndexConstraint IFF line 12 is uncommented. Because line 12 and line 15 
#	have the same Pkey. If both lines are uncommented, the second one SHOULD fail.
# * Line 14 fails due to how the Java model code was written. In the setAttribute() implementation, we
# 	first check to see if the VALUE for the key is NULL, then we return with error if so. This test is not valid.
